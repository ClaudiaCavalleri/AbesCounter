<h3><a name="description">Description</a></h3>
<p>The request for this project was to create a simple app that works as a counter, using JavaScript to increase and decrease the number displayed.</p>
<p>I took the inspiration for this project form an old videogame called Abe's Oddysee.</p>
<p>The purpose of the game was to escspe from Rupture farms and save as much employees mudokon as you can because the Glukkons nwants to kill them all.</p>
<p>While Abe was running through the dark path of Rupture Farms, 
   you sometimes find a big black screen that dislplay the number of employees escaped, died and left.</p>
<br>
<p>So in this app the user can push the button "+" to increase or "-" to decrease the number of saved empolyees.</p>
<br>
<p>Remember that the final victory of the game depends on the number of mudokons you saved through the time!</p>

<h3><a name="prob">Problems and solutions</a></h3>
<p>For this project I used HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript (basics).</p>
<p>I met two problems on my path of developing this app:</p>
<ul>
  <li>to have two different event triggered at the same time, like the "+" button that causes an increment in the Escaped number
    and a decrement in the employees one.
    The solution was to create two more funcions and use "addEventListener" two times on the same event.
  <li>add a "0" before numbers < 10. It was quite easy to fix (using an "if condition"), 
                                    the difficult thing was to understand where to put it.</li>
</ul>
<p>At the end, it was very satisfying to see everything is working!</p>

<h3><a name="coach">The Coach says...</a></h3>
<p>It was very annoying for me to read the answer from the coach: he says there are some problrms that has to be fixed.</p>
<p>First of all, I switched italian english; then I unified a lot of rows of js codes beacuse there where some functions that were redundant.</p>
<p>So, here we are with the version 2.0!</p>
